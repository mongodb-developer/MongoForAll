# MongoForAll
A ready-to-run forms based frontend for MongoDB Atlas and Realm

This project is nascent and not ready to use - this README will be update when it is.

The intent is to provide a code-free path to your first application in MognoDB Atlas using the Realm Backend.
Realm mobile database capabilities will come later.

This application is intented to provide end users in any industry with the the ability to:

  * Query and Retrieve records from Atlas
  * View Records in structured forms using a Browser
  * Add, Edit and Delete Existing Records
  * Follow Relationships between Records

All in the context of secure Authenticated and Authorized Access.

Some Key design ideas for the project.

* Usable with Zero Coding
* Easily Brandable
* Full support for Dynamic Data with dynamic forms.
* Automatic or Explicit form design


Goals for the future include:

* Text / Relevance Search
* Mobile Version
